To monitor network interfaces on Cisco devices using Zabbix, you can set up a **network interface discovery rule**. This allows Zabbix to automatically discover and monitor all network interfaces on a device. Here's how you can do it:

### Step 1: Configure the Network Interface Discovery Rule

1. **Go to Discovery Rules:**
   - Navigate to **Configuration â†’ Hosts**.
   - Select the Cisco device host for which you want to discover network interfaces.
   - Go to the **Discovery rules** tab.

2. **Create a New Discovery Rule:**
   - Click **Create discovery rule**.
   - Fill in the following fields:

   - **Name:** Give it a name, e.g., "Network Interface Discovery".
   - **Type:** Select `SNMP agent` (assuming you're using SNMP to monitor the Cisco device).
   - **SNMP OID:** Use `.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.1` which corresponds to `ifIndex`, a standard SNMP OID for discovering network interfaces.
   - **Key:** Use a key like `net.if.discovery` to identify this discovery rule.

3. **Set Update Interval:**
   - Specify the interval at which Zabbix should run the discovery rule (e.g., `1h` for once every hour).

4. **Set SNMP Community/Authentication:**
   - Ensure that the SNMP community string or authentication details are correctly set up under the **Host** settings. This is required for SNMP to work.

5. **Add Filters (Optional):**
   - You can add filters to exclude certain interfaces from discovery, such as loopback interfaces. Filters are based on SNMP OIDs or other properties.

### Step 2: Define Item Prototypes

1. **Go to Item Prototypes:**
   - After creating the discovery rule, navigate to the **Item prototypes** tab within the same discovery rule.

2. **Create an Item Prototype:**
   - Click **Create item prototype**.
   - Fill in the following fields:

   - **Name:** e.g., "Interface {#IFNAME} - Inbound Traffic".
   - **Type:** Select `SNMP agent`.
   - **Key:** Use a key like `ifInOctets[{#SNMPINDEX}]`.
   - **SNMP OID:** Use `.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.10.{#SNMPINDEX}` (this OID corresponds to `ifInOctets`, which tracks inbound traffic in bytes).
   - **Units:** Use `B` for bytes.
   - **Applications:** Add this item to an application group like "Network Interfaces".

3. **Create Additional Item Prototypes:**
   - You may want to create item prototypes for:
     - Outbound traffic: `ifOutOctets[{#SNMPINDEX}]` with OID `.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.16.{#SNMPINDEX}`
     - Interface status: `ifOperStatus[{#SNMPINDEX}]` with OID `.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.8.{#SNMPINDEX}`
     - Error rates, etc.

4. **Link Item Prototypes to Discovery:**
   - These item prototypes will be automatically created for each discovered interface based on the discovery rule.

### Step 3: Create Trigger Prototypes (Optional)

1. **Go to Trigger Prototypes:**
   - In the same discovery rule, navigate to the **Trigger prototypes** tab.

2. **Create a New Trigger Prototype:**
   - Click **Create trigger prototype**.
   - Define a trigger based on your needs, such as:

   - **Name:** "Interface {#IFNAME} - High Inbound Traffic".
   - **Expression:** `{HostName:ifInOctets[{#SNMPINDEX}].avg(5m)} > 10000000` (trigger if inbound traffic exceeds 10 MB in 5 minutes).
   - Set the severity level, e.g., "Warning".

3. **Additional Trigger Prototypes:**
   - You can create additional triggers for different conditions like interface down, high error rates, etc.

### Step 4: Apply and Test

1. **Apply Changes:**
   - Save all your changes in the discovery rule and item prototypes.

2. **Test Discovery:**
   - Allow Zabbix some time to run the discovery rule. It should automatically create items for each network interface on your Cisco device.
   - Verify that the discovered items are being populated with data.

3. **Monitor Results:**
   - Check the `Latest data` to see the values being collected from the network interfaces.
   - Review triggers to ensure alerts are working as expected.

### Summary
- **Discovery Rule:** Use SNMP to discover interfaces with OID `.1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.1`.
- **Item Prototypes:** Create items to monitor various metrics (inbound/outbound traffic, status, errors).
- **Trigger Prototypes:** Set up triggers for alerting based on conditions like high traffic or interface down.

This setup allows Zabbix to automatically monitor all interfaces on Cisco devices without manually configuring each one. Let me know if you need further assistance!
